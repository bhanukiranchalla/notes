What does the repository contain?
Personal notes

Which topics are covered here?
Various topics including but not limited to Computer Science, Programming Languages, Mathematics, Self-Help, Life ;)

What's the purpose of writing/making notes?
For reasons unknown, I fully _understand_ a topic only when I make notes (as in, write it by hand, not by typing, not by memorizing). Recently I realized there are way too many (actual) notebooks lying around, making it difficult to carry around and tad inefficient to keep track. Hence the efforts to digizite them for easier reference and primarily for personal use.

How is the notes prepared?
The notes added under this repository could have been prepared in any one of the 3 methods:
1) Digitizing my existing (paper) notebooks by Photographing them.
2) Digitizing ny handwritten notes on iPad using GoodNotes app.
3) (Very rare) Typed notes on my PC.

Could someone else use them?
By all means, if you find them useful (and legible :D).
