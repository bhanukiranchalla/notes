What does this repository contain?
Personal notes

What topics are covered here?
Various topics including but not limited to Computer Science, Programming Languages, Mathematics, Life ;)

What is the purpose of writing/making notes?
For reasons unknown, I only understand a topic fully when I make notes (as in, write it by hand, not by typing, not by memorizing). Recently I realized there are way too many notebooks, which makes it less portable and inefficient to keep track. Hence digiziting them for easier reference and primarily for personal use.

How is the notes prepared?
The notes added under this repository could have been prepared in one of the 3 methods:
1) Photographing and digitizing my existing (paper) notebooks.
2) Handwritten notes on my iPad and digitizing notes using GoodNote app.
3) (Very rare) Typed notes on my computer.

Can someone else use them?
By all means, if you find them useful (and legible :D).
